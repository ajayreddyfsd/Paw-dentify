# 🐾 Paw-dentify  
*A Deep Learning Model for Dog Breed Identification*

## 📌 Overview  
**Paw-dentify** is a deep learning-based image classification project built to identify dog breeds from photographs. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques, the model can classify over 100 dog breeds with strong accuracy. The project is based on the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification dataset.
